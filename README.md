# Empirical Comparison of Lane Following and Sign Recognition techniques on a Raspberry Pi car

**Date:** 2nd March to 29th May 2018

This research paper compares different techniques for lane following and sign recognition, implemented on a Raspberry Pi car, based on the time taken for processing. For lane following, a widely used CNN architecture is compared to a purely Computer Vision based approach; while for sign recognition a classical CNN architecture is compared to more modern object detection algorithms such as YOLO, SSD and R-CNN. Contrary to conventional research work which takes place on real self-driving cars or simulators, this paper emphasizes prototype cars powered by microcomputers that anyone can assemble and implement functionalities on.

**The code is completely experimental and was written only with the purpose of getting results for the Research Paper. It is attached here for reference.**
